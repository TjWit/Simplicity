# Simplicity

## Inviting the bot.

Obviously, if you don't have a server that you have admin powers in, create one. Nextly in your browser copy and paste this link.

```
https://discordapp.com/invite something here
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 It may ask for the bot to have admin powers in your server, please allow that so Simplicity is able to run every command in your server without error.
{% endhint %}

Once you have invited the bot, it should be pretty straightforward to set up, just type in the command for the help menu, and everything should be explained there.

The default prefix for Simplicity is: `$`

{% code title="Discord Channel" %}
```bash
$help
```
{% endcode %}
