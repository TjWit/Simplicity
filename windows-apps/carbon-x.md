# Carbon X

## Installing Carbon X

The first thing that you need to do before downloading any executor is disable your anti-virus. Now go to the website for Carbon X, using the link below. Once you are there, there should be a button that says "Download Now" click that.

```
https://carbonx.iitstyler.repl.co/
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 You will be prompted to join our Discord server. You must join that, or you will not be able to download the application, as the bootstrapper is on our Discord.
{% endhint %}

One you have downloaded the bootstrapper, drag it onto your desktop, run it, then all the files should be downloaded and extracted onto your desktop. Now find the folder named "Carbon X v\(version \#\)" open it and run the EXE file.

Then you should be all set up with Carbon X.
